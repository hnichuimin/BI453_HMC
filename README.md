# BI453_HMC
## Comparative Genomics of Solanimycin Antibiotic Production Clusters in Diverse Bacterial Genomes
This repository contains all intermediete files and genome assembly annotations generated throughout the BI453 project that were used during data analysis and figure generation. 
These intermediate sequence files were produced using the _dickeya solani_ genome assembly, genbank accession: CP017453.1.
The genome annotation were produced using Prokka, prokaryotic genome annotation software.
